# Plot
Seeking companionship, a young Ellen prays for any spirit to bring her love, only to be attacked by a beastly vision, causing her to have a seizure.

In 1838, an adult Ellen lives in the town of Wisborg, Germany, with husband Thomas Hutter, an estate agent. Hoping to gain financial security, Thomas accepts a commission from his employer, Herr Knock, to sell Schloss Grünewald, a decrepit stately home in Wisborg, to the reclusive, eccentric Count Orlok. Unknown to Thomas, Knock arranged this as part of an occult pact with Orlok.

Ellen becomes fearful and asks Thomas to remain with her, confessing that before their wedding, she dreamed that she married Death himself with only corpses in attendance, and enjoyed it. He dismisses her fears and departs for Orlok's castle in Transylvania's Carpathian Mountains, leaving her with a wealthy friend, Friedrich Harding. Arriving in Transylvania, Thomas is shunned by the local Romani peasantry for affiliating with Orlok. That night, he witnesses them with what they claim is a vampire's corpse, impaling its chest with an iron stake; the corpse jolts in pain and vomits.

Arriving at the castle next evening, Thomas is greeted by an impatient, menacing Orlok, who dines with him and insists on finalizing Schloss Grünewald's purchase immediately. Orlok disregards Thomas's inquiry about the villagers and what he saw, and when Thomas cuts his thumb on a bread knife, Orlok mesmerizes him and drinks his blood, revealing himself as a vampire. The next night, Orlok takes Thomas’s locket, which contains a lock of Ellen's hair, and has him sign a mysterious document written in an occult script. Thomas demands to go home, as he’s plagued by nightmares, but Orlok demands he stay until no longer ill. Thomas later finds Orlok sleeping in his coffin and tries to kill him with a pick, but he springs awake and counterattacks. Fleeing the Count's wolves, Thomas falls into a river while escaping. He is found and nursed to health by nuns, who entreat him to stay and recuperate, but he rushes back to Wisborg to protect Ellen. Orlok sails for Wisborg with a crate of grave dirt and plague-infested rats, killing the ship's crew along the way.

Meanwhile, Ellen is attacked by bouts of sleepwalking and seizures, which Wilhelm Sievers, her doctor, struggles to treat. As the episodes worsen, Sievers turns to his mentor Albin Eberhart Von Franz, a brilliant scientist ostracized in Switzerland for his occult beliefs. Von Franz deduces that Ellen is under the spell of the Nosferatu, a demonic, plague-bearing vampire. Friedrich is skeptical, believing her symptoms spring from anxiety over Thomas's absence. Knock is institutionalized after a gleeful rampage, and both he and Ellen prophesy Orlok's impending arrival. Sievers and Von Franz realize that the two are under the same spirit; searching Knock's office, they learn Orlok is the Nosferatu.

Thomas returns to Wisborg as Orlok's arrival brings the plague. Knock escapes from custody, killing a porter, and escorts Orlok to Schloss Grünewald, while Orlok appears to Ellen in a dream, taunting her that he tricked Thomas into signing divorce papers. Orlok warns that she must approve the divorce within two more nights and reaffirm the pact she made when she summoned him as a girl, or he will kill Thomas and let the plague consume Wisborg. The following night, Orlok kills Friedrich's family to demonstrate his power; a grief-maddened Friedrich then dies of the plague while committing necrophilia with his wife's corpse.

Von Franz plans an expedition with Thomas and Sievers to destroy Orlok's Schloss Grünewald resting place, but from his occult research, he theorizes that the Nosferatu can only truly be destroyed by a fair maiden's willing sacrifice. Ellen agrees to the plan and psychically summons Orlok to her chamber. The three men unexpectedly find Knock in Orlok's coffin and kill him; Von Franz proceeds to burn the whole crypt, but Thomas realizes the expedition was a diversion and rushes back to save Ellen. She allows the Count to feast on her blood until sunrise, which causes Orlok to die and return to an inanimate corpse. Thomas bursts into the bedroom and holds Ellen’s hand as she dies of exsanguination, with her sacrifice killing Orlok and ending the plague.
